# Repository Name
pneumonia-detection-in-chest-X-rays

# Title of the Project
Comparative Analysis of Image-Based and Feature-Based Approaches for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-rays

# Short Description of the Project
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques (Rajpurkar et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, including annotated images of pneumonia and normal cases, we aim to develop and compare image-based and feature-based approaches. Our goal is to identify the most effective method for accurate and interpretable pneumonia detection, contributing to improved patient outcomes through early diagnosis and treatment. This model will classify patients based on their chest X-ray images as either having pneumonia (1) or not having pneumonia (0).

# Objectives of the Project
**1. Image Analysis:** Develop and evaluate deep learning models to classify chest X-rays directly. This approach leverages deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to perform end-to-end image classification. The models directly process raw chest X-ray images to classify them as normal or pneumonia.
**2. Feature Analysis:** Extract meaningful features from the images and use them to train and evaluate traditional machine learning models. In this approach, we first extract features from the chest X-ray images. These features are then used as inputs for traditional machine learning algorithms. The process includes steps such as feature extraction, selection, and transformation, followed by the application of machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests.

# Name of the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Chest X-ray dataset considered from the Research paper named **Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification**.

**Data Source:** https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2

**Type of the Dataset:** X-ray Images

# Description of the Dataset
The considered dataset has the following information for better reference:
- Separate folders to train and validate/test the model.
- Enough number of Chest X-ray images to train the model to detect and diagnose Pneumonia.
- The target variable for classification is whether patient has pneumonia or not.

# Goal of the Project using this Dataset
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of image-based and feature-based approaches for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. By evaluating the performance, robustness, and interpretability of deep learning and traditional machine learning models, we aim to identify the most effective method for accurately classifying chest X-rays as normal or pneumonia. This comparison will provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, ultimately contributing to improved detection and diagnosis of pneumonia, which can enhance patient outcomes and survival rates.

# Why did we choose this dataset
